# Learn Go
The goal of this project is to use Golang and Htmx to create a todo application.

## Pocketbase
PocketBase is an open source backend consisting of embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions, built-in auth management, convenient dashboard UI and simple REST-ish API.

It is is built in Go and can be extended with it.

By extending pocketbase i can skip a lot of mundane task required to develop an application.


Betting on my previous, knowledge and understanding to carry me here, and since pocketbase is open source i can always check the source.



## HTMX
